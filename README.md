# Smart-Mix-Diploma-Project
  There is a common issue which appears when people try to prepare something only with the ingredients which are already bought. The search on the cooking websites takes a long 
time, the results aren't optimized and you can buy the other ingredients which are needed faster and cheaper using this project. The project is a web application, the user can 
enter the ingredients which are already taken and the application filters by these ingredients and returns the recipes which are taken from other sites. For the recipes which 
contain more ingredients than the existing ingredients, the user will see the shortest and the cheapest way to purchase these ingredients using his / her location and the location
of the shops.
  The user can also add recipes to the "Favourites" section and, using this section and the pages which are frequently visited by this user, he sends and receives messages to and
from other users which have the same preferences as his / hers. The user can see the most visited and the most appreciated (by rating) recipes. When the user is close to a cake
shop or to a pastry which has a product which is also in the user's "Favourites" section, the user receives a notification.
